# iOSLaunchImages
Universal basic set of launch images for ios 7 &amp; 8, intended to get scratch projects up and running quickly.

In xCode 6 install the launch images as follows:

1) Remove existing LaunchImage folder. Go to File navigator > Image.xcassets and delete any LaunchImage folder.

2) Now simply select Images.xcassets and drag the folder LaunchImage.launchimage into the 2nd panel area. It should just work.

3) You can check to see if the launch images are set correctly by selecting your target and under general > App Icons and Launch Images you should see the folder you dragged in.
